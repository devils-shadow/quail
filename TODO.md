# TODO

A running list of outstanding tasks. Issues should be created for these items and prioritized.

- Implement DMARC validation for internet-facing deployments.
- Execute the WebSocket inbox plan in `docs/WEBSOCKET_INBOX_PLAN.md`.
- Add service health/status and storage usage reporting for operators.
- Expand automated coverage for ingest edge cases (multipart HTML, charsets, inline CID).
- Consider admin rate-limit tests if the UI exposes rate-limit feedback.
- Document a recommended reverse-proxy setup (nginx + OAuth2 example).
