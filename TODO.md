# TODO

A running list of outstanding tasks. Issues should be created for these items and prioritized.

- Implement DMARC validation for internet-facing deployments.
- Execute the WebSocket inbox plan in `docs/WEBSOCKET_INBOX_PLAN.md`.
- Add service health/status and storage usage reporting for operators.
- Expand automated coverage (focus on slow/integration groups) and stabilize local test runs.
- Document a recommended reverse-proxy setup (nginx + OAuth2 example).
